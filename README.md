# [CalcCLI](https://github.com/Unfit-Donkey/CalcCLI)
CalcCLI is a simple, open-source command-line calculator written in C.
Features include: complex numbers, everyday functions, custom functions, graphing, derivatives, units, and base conversion.

## Running the program
A basic knowledge of shell script is required.
Open Terminal and `cd` to this folder. Run `./build` on Linux and MacOS, or `build.bat` on Windows. Having GCC in your path is required. Then run `./calc` to actually run the program.
If you want to debug, instead run `./buildDebug` or `buildDebug.bat`, this will run `gcc` with the `-g` flag for debugging. You can then run `gdb calc` for debugging if you have GNU Debugger installed.
