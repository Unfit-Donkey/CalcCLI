## Code guidelines
Don't worry if you forget these, but they are helpful to follow.
- If function headers are changed, or you write a new function, they must also be changed in Calc.h.
- Try to format the code similar to the rest.
- Write comments!

## What to do with your idea
If you have a great idea on how to improve the project, but are too intimidated to write it, submit an issue. I will at least consider it.
