## What to do with your idea
If you have a great idea on how to improve the project, but are too intimidated to write it, submit an issue. I will at least consider it.

## Test
Before submitting a pull request run the tests, this should default to run for 5 seconds.
- `cd test`
- `./buildtest`
- or `buildtest.bat`
It should say `Failed 0 tests.`
